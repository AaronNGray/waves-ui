## baseTimeLine

This module is a layer/layout manager for time based visualisations written on top of [d3.js](http://d3js.org/).
The module by itself doesn't accomplish anything as long as you don't pass it in some visualisation layer or component.
For a detailed explanation on the philosophy and usage of this library please refer to [this blog post](http://wave.ircam.fr/publications/visual-tools/).

### Status

Currently work in progress, untested and undergoing API breaking changes etcâ€¦
More info, docs and tests to come.
